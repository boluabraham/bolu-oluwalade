    "During the week 2 and 3 periods, the community bonding continued and I started preparing for the start of the coding period  scheduled for June 1st. During this period, I communicated with my mentors using the libreHealth forums and groups, I read about the projects of others in the community and asked questions, when appropriate.<br> To familiarise myself with the FHIR components, I explored the FHIR specification documentations and created mockups for the components of interest which are Observation, Medication, MedicationRequest and MedicationStatement. I borke down the resources into smaller parts thus reducing the complexity of creating the components. <br>Below is a mockup created for the Medication resource with the Balsamiq wireframe.</span>"

    "Also during this period, I began  to learn and practice more on the use of the polymer 3 library to create web components. There are several resources available on the web that answered most of my questions. I also read about the PWA starter kit that helps to implement a progressive web app based on polymer elements. <br> In addition, I cloned the github repo containing the PWA created with the 2018 Librehealth GSoC <a href = \"https://gitlab.com/parumenon.pm/lh-toolkit-app\">project</a>. I implemented the PWA locally and navigated through it with the aim of getting a better understanding of its functionalities.\n",
