I was advised to be more open with my work to the other group memebers. I am going to consciously work on that moving forward. The next month is shaping up to be the most crucial  yet for the project, all hands must be on deck.</span>"

    "    <b><i>Coding update:</i></b> This week, I created three new components for the FHIR Observation Resources which are; fhir-observation-mwethod, fhir-obsevation-interpretation and fhir-observation-valuestring. These components can are based on the observation method, interpretation and valueString. The first two are Codable concept types which has a code, system and display fields as values in a key:value structure. The keys are 'method' and 'interpretation' respectively. The observation valuestring's value is a string type in a key:value structure. Please check out the documentation. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html\">here</a><br> I also created unit tests and the README documents for the custom elements. \n",

The submodule was a stop gap pending the time that the material-components are stable. It is now stable. It has a current version of 0.18.0 which was released this week after I made the Merge Request containing v0.15.0 Material Components. I might have to update it later in the project or not. I will decide that later.\n",
