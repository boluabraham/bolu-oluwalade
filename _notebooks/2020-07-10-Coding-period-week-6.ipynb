Because there are various categories of observations ranging from vital signs to labs and different use of observation resource from a physician making an observation in an observation note, to a record of vital signs and to the ordering and reporting of labs. I think the components would have a wide range of use. Below is a snippet of some of the components.\n",

This is because, it would be rather unusual to have a physician/radiologist/lab technician inputting the reference range of an observation. It seems like its general practice that those values are displayed based on the age and population the patient belongs.\n",
