    "The HL7 has developed several standards of EHR interoperability such as the HL7 V2, V3, Reference Information Model (RIM), and the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). These standards are widely used in EHR systems. Most recently, the HL7  developed a new standard called the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) based on the RESTful API. FHIR is built on a set of components called Resources, which combines the best features of the CDA, HL7 v2, and HL7 v3. A resource can be used to store and exchange healthcare data over an HTTP endpoint using GET/POST request. This makes data exchange seamless and lightweight compared to the previous standards.  \n",

This project presents me with an opportunity to contribute significantly to the development of an EHR system that supports FHIR Standards thereby promoting the interoperability of healthcare data.\n",

This project will be restricted to the Observation, Medication, MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest FHIR resources. These resources have a maturity level of level 3 and above. <br/>The Polymer library is used to create web components using HTML imports, HTML Template, Shadow DOM, and custom elements. The created web components in this project can be implemented in other EHR systems. The figure below shows the architecture of a typical web component.\n",
